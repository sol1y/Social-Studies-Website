                <p align=middle>It is my personal view that Ada Lovelace, the Historical feminist, was a significant Mover and Shaker since she has shaped the way people and the rest of the world think. This can be clearly shown by how Ada Lovelace developed curiosity and interest about machines and their potential, because of this, she has innovatively greatly improved Babbage’s machine into an Analytical Engine that uses a sequence of instructions constructed by a program. By doing this, she has showed people that curiosity can lead to a successful outcome and can change the future of our lives. By gaining curiosity and innovation, you can achieve something that will furthermore develop into everyday lives of our society. To this day, programming languages has helped shape our lives and the way we do things, although it is still developing, it has helped our environment and our world, remarkably. Not only this, but also another clear example of Lovelace shaping the way people think is the fact that Ada Lovelace created a programming language as a feminist back in the 1940’s. Back then, men were stereotyped to do everything ‘Manly’ such as Working in STEM, Inventing products etc, where women had fewer freedoms in society because they were known to do the more ‘Girly’ activities, such as staying at home and cooking, cleaning etc.  However, when Ada opened the worlds’ eyes to Programming as a women, this changed feminists lives forever. She showed that feminists can achieve great goals. She showed, as a feminist, that women can do ‘Manly’ activities. She helped feminism gain its power back and brought feminism to its feet and brough a sense of equality to women. From this, Ada Lovelace is a Mover and Shaker who has shaped the way people think, by promoting feminism to the rest of the world and shaping what people think about feminists. She also showed people that being curious and innovative is an impactful thing that can help lead you to success.

                <p align=middle>It is quite clear and obvious that Ada Lovelace is a remarkable Mover and Shaker because she has effect/ed people beyond her own country of residence. We can see this by Ada Lovelace introducing to the world an explicit vision of the capabilities of computers. From this, we can identify that Ada Lovelace affected the whole of the world because she showed the world what computers are and how crucially they may impact our lives. By successfully carrying out her complex algorithms through digital technology, she allowed the world to understand the concepts of digital technology and showed the world that digital technology can and will be a significant discovery for mankind. For example, keeping everyone connected worldwide and communicating, storing specific data, access and publishing information and many other possibilities. Another example is how Ada Lovelace showed that computers can carry out complex algorithms to solve problems. Another example is how Ada Lovelace’s mother pushed Ada Lovelace so far into mathematics and she pressured her into trying to become a mathematician so she would not turn out as a poet like her father. However, Ada Lovelace decided that she can become and do whatever she wants to do. Because of this, Ada Lovelace has showed the world that historic situations, such as discovering computers, can come in such uneasy circumstances. She showed many humans that it is ok to do what you love and to not do what people want you to do. From this, we can conclude that Ada Lovelace is a Mover and Shaker because she has made an impact on countries outside of her own residence.

            <div class="Text">

                <p align=middle>Another principal points to consider, as to why Ada Lovelace is a Mover and Shaker, is how she has affected people after she has passed. An example of this is how Ada Lovelace’s mother pushed Ada Lovelace so far into mathematics and she pressured her into trying to become a mathematician so she would not turn out as a poet like her father. However, Ada Lovelace decided that she can become and do whatever she wants to do, thus pushing herself into the programming industry. Because of this, Ada Lovelace has shown the world that historic situations, such as discovering computers, can come in such uneasy circumstances. She showed many humans that it is ok to do what you love and to not do what people want you to do, she allowed people after her passing to persevere and do what you love because if you love something, you can achieve important things. Another example is how Ada Lovelace suffered from a serious life-threatening medical condition; she did not let that stop her from perusing her dream. While she was in her ‘Death Bed,’ Ada studied animals to try and invent a machine that allows humans to fly. She investigated materials that could serve as wings and she was perseverance because she had a condition that could kill her, but she still carried on doing what she loves. Due to this, she has inspired people to be perseverant and not let conditions that may harm you stop you doing what you love. She showed that there are always ways around challenging situations as well as showing that you must preserve, never give up, and try to approach situations differently. Unfortunately, Ada Lovelace passed away due to the condition. These evidence and examples have shown us that Ada Lovelace in a Mover and Shaker because she has Shaked people after she has passed. Showing people to follow what you love and not what someone else wants you to do, as well as indicating that there are always ways to follow your dreams even when there are life situations stopping you, showing that perseverance is key to success.

            <p align=middle>It is clear to me that Ada Lovelace is a significant Mover and Shaker because she has influenced people outside her own discipline. This can be seen by Ada Lovelace’s actions influencing women all over the world to gain confidence and how she brought/is bringing women together. Ada Lovelace inspired a non-profit organization which arranges astonishing training programs and conferences to elevate and guide woman working in STEM. (Science, technology, engineering, and math) Because of this, women feel comfortable and have been brought together because of Ada Lovelace. Another clear example as to why she covers the 4th criteria is the fact her technology and her discovery has developed and advanced so much overtime that it has impacted our everyday life. When Ada first created the Analytic machine and the mathematical algorithms, her intention was to just use it for advanced calculation. However, without realizing, she created the future of humanity. She allowed humans to open our eyes to the potential of technology and how major it is.  As I have said before, we use technology in our everyday life, at work, school, home etc. This is all thanks to Ada Lovelace and the development of technology. From this, we can clearly analyze that Ada Lovelace was in fact a historian who was a Mover and a Shaker. She influenced people outside their own discipline because she brought feminists together and influences those working in STEM as well as impacting our lives and our future.
