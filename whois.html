                <p align=middle>Ada Lovelace is a historic Women who is known as the ‘Mother of computers. Ada was born on 10 December 1815 in London to two parents, Lord Byron, and Lady Byron. Lord was a Poet and Lady was a Mathematician. When Ada was little, her father Byron would cheat on his wife with other women multiple times. Her mother found out and left Lord with Ada Lovelace, unfortunately, at the age of 10, Ada’s father passed away. Her mother had a deep aggression against Lord Byron after she found out and promoted the idea of math and science to her daughter to help prevent Ada from gaining his insanity. Fortunately, Ada Lovelace not only loved Math, but also loved poetry as well. At the age of 20, she married William King in 1835 and made her the countess of Lovelace. Back in the day, education for Ada Lovelace was particularly hard to access, however she was a highly intelligent mathematician, she understood complex equations at such an early age which really made her stand out. Due to Ada Lovelace and her highly known social representation, Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage. Both were highly intelligent mathematicians who had common interests and developed a meaningful relationship with one another. Babbage introduced Ada Lovelace to the Analytic Engine which quickly grasped Ada’s attention, she was particularly interested in this engine. Between 1842 and 1843 Ada translated an article which was conducted by an Italian engineer, within Babbage’s machine, adding Ada’s own notes onto the translation, this translation was known to be the first programming language. She quickly realized that this translation (supplementing her own notes) was an algorithm for the Analytic machine that helps conduct complex algorithms. Unfortunately, Ada’s work she was working on was concluded due to her serious cancer medical condition, uterine cancer, at the early age of 36. Because of Ada Lovelace, the world was opened up to the capabilites of computers and how significant these devices are. To this day, computer programming has been developing so much that Games are being created, Websites are being created, Advance Life changing situations are happening, we are able to detect what is beyond earth, and so much more. Computers are such significant devices that has been impacting our everyday life, and will do for many many generations. Ada lovelace, the Mover and Shaker, is a story that everyone should know of because she has Influnced the way people think, Impacted society after she has passed, impacted nationally and gloabally and finally impacted people beyond her own dicipline.
